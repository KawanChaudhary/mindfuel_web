## Configuration and Setup

In order to run this project locally, simply fork and clone the repository or download as zip and unzip on your machine.

- Open the project in your prefered code editor.
- Go to terminal -> New terminal (If you are using VS code)
- Split your terminal into two (run the Frontend on one terminal and the Backend on the other terminal)

In the first terminal

```
$ cd Frontend
$ npm install (to install frontend-side dependencies)

To run the application on localhost change the backend url in directory -> Frontend/src/Axios/axiosInstance.js
Replace `${process.env.REACT_APP_BACKEND_URI}` with "http://localhost:5000/"

```

In the second terminal

- cd Backend and Set environment variables in config.env under ./config.
- Create your mongoDB connection url, which you'll use as your MONGO_URI.
- Setup your firebase app, storage bucket and generating private key JOSN
- Supply the following credentials in .env file.

```
